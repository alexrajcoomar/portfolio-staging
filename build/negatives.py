"""Tests of controls: for every check, a recorded case where the claim is
deliberately made false and the check is shown to catch it.

A register that prints "held" beside every claim proves only that the
checks agree with themselves. A control that has never been observed to
fail is not evidence that it operates. So each check here has at least one
falsification: an edit to a copy of the tree that makes the claim false at
its source (a piece, the content, the fonts, the workflow, or the build's
own code), after which the whole build is run in that copy and must refuse,
naming the check. The result is recorded in content/negatives.json with a
digest of the code it was recorded against; the register prints a checked
claim as held only while a current, caught falsification stands behind
every check it cites, and prints "untested" otherwise.

The falsifications are edits to sources, never to the checks: a falsifier
that reached into a check would prove nothing. Each one is described in
one sentence beside its row, so a reader can judge whether it is the
failure that matters.
