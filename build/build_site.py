    <p>Most of what I build starts as a problem I have: a course that will not stay in my head, a claim
    I do not believe, a process I keep repeating by hand. The output is usually an interactive
    document, because a diagram you can interrogate beats a paragraph you can skim. Rather than let
    those sit in a downloads folder, they live here, running, where anyone can use them.</p>

    <p>Two things are worth separating. One course, AFM 291, has been rebuilt here end to end:
    {len(afm)} pieces, {sum(x['words'] for x in afm):,} words, every chapter running the same structure so a topic
    can be found the same way twice. Alongside it sits {ST['independent']['words']:,} words of research
    nobody assigned. The corpus figure on the <a href="index.html#corpus">home page</a> draws that
    split rather than claiming it.</p>

    <h3>How the work is organised</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Research and writing</strong> holds the pieces where the argument is the point, plus
      the method work on how the rest gets built and audited.</li>
      <li><strong>Coursework</strong> groups every reference and trainer by the course it was built
      for, with a coverage table showing what exists and what does not.</li>
      <li><strong>Interactive tools</strong> are the things you use rather than read. {N_PWA} install to a
      phone home screen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A note on the material</h3>
    <p>These are my own artefacts, written by me for my own use. They are not course materials,
    not official solutions, and not a substitute for the standards themselves. Where a figure or a
    rule matters, check the primary source: the CPA Canada Handbook, the Income Tax Act, or the CRA.</p>

  <div class="prose measure">
    <dl>
      <dt>One declared rule per piece</dt>
      <dd>Each research page states once, near the top, what its marks mean, then holds that rule to the
      end. The rule is derived from the subject, so no two pieces share one. The
      <a href="index.html#corpus">corpus figure</a> obeys the same convention: one square is
      {figs.UNIT} words, solid is independent, an open outline is coursework.</dd>

      <dt>Colour</dt>
      <dd>Chart colours come from a validated categorical palette, checked for lightness band, chroma
      floor, colour-vision separation and contrast against both the light and the dark surface before
      use. Colour never carries meaning on its own: every figure's numbers are restated in a table or in
      the running text, and every mark that means something also differs in fill or shape.</dd>

      <dt>Typography</dt>
      <dd>Inter Variable, subset to the {FONT_CODEPOINTS} characters the corpus actually uses and
      self-hosted at {FONT_BYTES:,} bytes, with a metric-matched fallback face so the page does not
      reflow when the font lands. If the file fails to load, the site keeps working on the system
      stack. The build fails on any page character the subset lacks, so the number above is checked
      rather than believed.</dd>

      <dt>A number you can open</dt>
      <dd>A counted number on these pages is set with a dotted underline. Pointing at it or pressing it
      shows the definition it was counted under, the file it was measured from, the script that measured
      it and the record that holds it. The totals sit in the Tab order; a number inside a row opens
      with a pointer only, so a keyboard reader is not made to stop at every figure of every row, and
      what its dialog would say is the row's own link and the definition above. With scripts off the
      number stands as text and the definitions are the list above; nothing about the number itself
      depends on the script.</dd>

      <dt>Surfaces</dt>
      <dd>Warm paper in light, a near-black ground in dark, hairline rules, no rounded corners. The
      shell pages paint no drop shadow; the search panel sits on the browser's own backdrop. On a
      piece a shadow sits only under what floats over its text: the contents drawer on a phone, the
      reading-position pill, the section menu and the tips; a piece's own sheet keeps whatever it
      declared. One accent, blue, for the independent work on the sphere and for links. A second
      accent, violet, means one thing: a link one document's prose makes to another. It is the colour
      of the chords on both spheres, of the key entry that names them, of the link counts in the
      sphere's card and of the one count of recorded links under the home sphere, and it appears
      nowhere else; it is violet because no figure on this site has spent that hue. A panel sits one step above the ground behind a one-pixel edge. The one gradient
      on the site is the light around the sphere, which encodes nothing and is drawn outside the disc
      so it darkens no mark. Dark mode is a selected set of tokens rather than an inversion, and the
      manual toggle wins over the system setting in both directions.</dd>

    <p>No framework, no runtime dependency, and nothing loaded from another origin except where
    the exceptions below say so. No tracking, no cookies, no analytics. {len(P)} pieces served as
    static files by GitHub Pages.
    The {len(SHELL_PAGES)} pages the build generates, this one included, share one stylesheet and one
    script; each piece carries its own styling inside itself, so a change to the site's look cannot
    reach into a piece and a broken piece cannot reach the site.</p>
    <p>The listing pages are generated. Content lives in one file, <code>content/pieces.json</code>:
    every piece's title, description, tags, section and position. A script reads it and rewrites the
    listing pages, and a GitHub Action runs that script after every change. Any piece whose file
    changed is opened in a headless browser first and counted, which is where every number on this
    page comes from. Nothing here is typed in by hand, which is the only way the counts stay true.</p>
    <p>Figures are static SVG generated at build time, so every chart renders with JavaScript disabled.
    JavaScript adds only enhancements: the theme toggle, the search palette, the library filters, the
    reveal-on-scroll, and the count of passages this browser has opened on the Atlas.</p>
    <p>Accessibility: skip link, visible focus, headings in order, every figure labelled, colour never
    load-bearing on its own, and reduced motion respected. The generated pages print: sticky elements
    release, nothing stays hidden, and figures avoid breaking across pages. Each of those sentences is a
    row in the <a href="controls.html#register">register</a>, with the check that tests it and the last result,
    or the word asserted where nothing tests it yet.</p>
    <p>{ex['kinds']['doc']} of these pages began as Word documents and {ex['kinds']['md']} as markdown
    notes. Each was converted once, by a script that lives outside this repository, and the HTML it
    produced is the record: it is what the build counts, what the Atlas harvests and what a reader
    saves. Nothing is converted at build time. The build does own the sentence at the foot of each
    converted piece that says so, and the footer under it, and it proves on every run that the text
    outside those two blocks is byte for byte what it was.</p>

          document sits is a rule: each origin owns a zone of latitude whose area is its share
          of the sections (independent work in the north, coursework across the middle, personal
          interest in the south); within its zone each document starts at the height its
          cumulative section count gives it, largest first, on a longitude that steps by the
          golden angle from one document to the next, and is drawn as a disc of two thirds of its
          share of the sphere; the discs are settled apart, a fixed number of steps with no
          randomness, until no two touch, each held inside its zone. A document's own sections lie
          on an equal-area spiral inside its disc, the first at the centre, each next one a golden
          angle round and a ring further out, so a document reads as one cluster and its reading
          order runs from the centre to the rim. A wide disc is a document of many sections, and
          the third of the sphere that no disc holds is the space between documents. The build
          recomputes every centre, every radius and every mark from the section counts on every
          run and refuses a sphere that disagrees (check 28).</p>

    seen to fail is not evidence that it can. So every check on this site has a falsification on
    record: an edit to a copy of the site that makes the claim false at its source (a piece, the
    content, a font, the workflow, or the build's own code), after which the whole build is run in
    that copy and must refuse, naming the check. A claim prints <b>held</b> only while a current,
    caught falsification stands behind every check it cites; otherwise it prints <b>untested</b>.
    A claim nothing tests prints <b>asserted</b>; a claim measured in a browser prints <b>not yet
    measured</b> when its record is older than the page.</p>
