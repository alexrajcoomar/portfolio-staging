"""The Dollarama valuation: a capital cost allowance schedule and two anchors.

Every input is either transcribed from the issuer's filed annual financial
statements (content/valuation-inputs.json, each figure carrying the statement,
note and PDF page it was read from) or derived here from those figures. Nothing
is remembered. Where an input cannot come from the filing at all, it is declared
in ASSUMED below and appears in the output under that name, so a reader can see
the whole of what the model was told rather than the whole of what it concluded.

The point of the exercise is the tax shield. A conventional model proxies the
shield with book depreciation. Canadian tax law does not use book depreciation:
it uses capital cost allowance, computed on undepreciated capital cost by class
at prescribed rates, and the two bases differ. This module computes both and
reports the difference.

Run:  python3 build/valuation.py
Out:  content/valuation-output.json, and a readable summary on stdout.
